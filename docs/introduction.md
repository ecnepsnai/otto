# Introduction to Otto

Welcome to Otto! Where things are "Ottomatic Beyond Belief!"

Otto is a way for you to run scripts on remote hosts from a single server. It supports most Unix like systems, including: Linux, BSD (Free, Net), macOS, and Solaris.

Otto is composed of a few main components: The Otto Service, Hosts, Groups, and Scripts.

# The Otto Service

The otto service is the central location where hosts, groups, and scripts are configured.

# Hosts

Otto hosts, or clients, are individual machines running a compatible Unix like operating system. Scripts run on hosts.

# Groups

Groups are logical groupings of hosts where scripts are associated. The scripts that a host can run as determined by
what are assigned to the group.

# Scripts

Scripts are command line executables that you can run on hosts. You can use whatever languange you want, including Bash and Python.
