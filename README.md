# otto

Otto is an automation toolkit for UNIX-like computers. It's designed to be fast and efficient with thousands of servers, and have no runtime requirements on targets.

**Warning:** Otto is still in-development. While it is absolutely usable, there may be breaking changes between releases that might cause data loss.

For documentation, see the `docs/` directory.
