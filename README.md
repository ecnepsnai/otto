**Welcome to Otto, where things are *Ottomatic beyond belief!***

## What is Otto?

Otto is a automatic toolkit for Linux and BSD systems. It allows you to easily run scripts against many servers from a cental interface. At a fundamental level it aims to strike a balance between the scripting power of Ansible with the centralized configuration of Puppet.

## Who should use it?

Otto works great for power users, at-home-sysadmins, and developers with small-to-medium sized clusters.

Even if you only have two Linux machines, Otto can provide value in helping save you time when maintaining those systems.

## How can I learn more?

Take a look at our [documentation](https://github.com/ecnepsnai/otto/tree/pre-release/docs)!
